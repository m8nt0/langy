ðŸ”¹ entities/ â€“ Who/What is in your system

    What goes here: Business objects with identity and lifecycle

    Example: TechObject.ts, Application.ts, Library.ts, Version.ts

    Why: These are your "nouns" that hold data and enforce behavior.

    Tip: Entities can reference each other but must not depend on external services.
