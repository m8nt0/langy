ðŸ§  What Is the domain/ Layer?

The domain/ folder represents the heart of your system â€” the business rules, core data structures, and invariants that define what the app is about, not how it's implemented.

It is pure, meaning it doesn't know about databases, frameworks, or UIs â€” it's just logic and models.
