ðŸ“¦ compute/

Handles where and how computational work is executed â€” this is important in distributed systems (e.g., offloading to cloud or edge).
adapters/ â€” Different compute execution contexts

    CloudCompute.ts: Runs tasks on a cloud service (e.g., AWS Lambda, GCP).

    EdgeCompute.ts: Executes on edge nodes (closer to user for low latency).

    LocalCompute.ts: Executes locally on the host machine.

    P2PCompute.ts: Peer-to-peer execution (e.g., distributed job delegation).

    index.ts: Barrel file exporting all compute adapter modules.

providers/ â€” Common compute interfaces

    ComputeProvider.ts: Interface or abstraction all compute types implement (e.g., .runTask() or .schedule()).

    index.ts: Barrel for provider exports.

ðŸ“Œ Purpose: Abstracts where tasks run, enabling flexible deployment.
